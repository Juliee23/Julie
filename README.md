<h1> About Me !</h1>
<p align='justify'>Hey there! I am a LEGO fan. 🐜 I always refresh my skills on <a href="https://www.sololearn.com/en/profile/27723571" target="blank">SoloLearn</a> whenever I'm on a break. I wish I had a coding buddy to be honest 😆 I read mystery novels. I listen to neo soul, RnB, Afro Beats and House music!!! Top artists are; Sabrina Claudio, Cleo Sol and Tom Misch 🎸🎧 </p>

<p align="justify">Otherwise, <a href="https://github.com/Juliee23" target="_blank">I code</a>  🔍 and I mainly write code on Html, JS and CSS. Recently I've started to branch out to writing more about React and I can give tech talks about being self taught,Html, JavaScript, CSS, React.js 🥑 and all things web dev!. 🌱</p>

In the meantime, learning and utilising C#, Angular, .NET, ASP.NET, Docker, Kubernetes and MS SQL!
